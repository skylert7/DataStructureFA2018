in
the

the
actual
results
proved
to
be
rather
different
from
those
indicated
by
the
opinion
polls
opinion
polls
conducted
in
the
last
few
months
of
the
campaign
and
even
in
the
last
few
days
had
indicated
a
very
close
result
between
the
conservatives
and
labour
in
terms
of
numbers
of
votes
suggesting
that
one
of
the
main
parties
would
have
to
form
a
perhaps
complex
coalition
with
smaller
parties
in
order
to
govern
however
the
actual
results
showed
a
stronger
performance
by
the
conservatives
which
gave
them
an
overall
majority
since
labour
also
had
a
weaker
performance
than
the
polls
had
suggested
when
the
exit
poll
was
initially
presented
some
commentators
and
politicians
doubted
it
with
paddy
ashdown
even
declaring
if
this
poll
is
correct
i
will
publicly
eat
my
hat
on
your
programme
in
response
to
the
apparently
poor
results
for
the
liberal
democrats
the
exit
poll
was
eventually
proved
to
have
in
fact
overestimated
the
liberal
democrats
performance
if
the
survation
telephone
poll
may
had
been
published
it
would
have
